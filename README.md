# virtue
This is a video game that be made at someone's hackathon

The concept of this game is will be built with a touch screen display connected to a arduino (uno/mega) and portable battery

The device introduces itself as a Virtue-Signal.exe and portrays itself as the sole device capability of spiritual augmented reality - where it connects to your conscious and claims to know whether you are going to heaven or hell

Agreeing to the proposition will begin a sample/demo question that has no consequence on the overall result

Disagreeing will restart the device and dedisplay the opening lines

Next proposition is another harmless yet consequential decision that will then begin the virtue/sin mechanic
(someone hands you a cig, do you accept or? and the options are either +1 virtue or +! indulgence)

Virtual points outweigh sin points by 2x, so when totalled at the end of the game they will be multiplied and then compared to sin points

Neither of these values are ever displayed to the player, the only indication that immoral decisions are happening is the scenarios become more and more ethically questionable (sometimes there will be no correct answer)

Some scenarios will be gimmes for the purpose of getting free virtue points, but also stopping points for the player to purposely worsen their sin score and descend a level lower in the scenario tier list

the idea is to not take the "heaven or hell" conceptally too cynically, bc it's quickly distanced from that concept to something more immersive and interesting than the results of a facebook-like quiz "where do you go when you die" 

The concept of building my own console is still relevant as its responsible for contributing an analog horror concept of forcing the player to use an interface they're not familiar with
