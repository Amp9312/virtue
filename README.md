# virtue
This is a video game that be made at someone's hackathon

The concept of this game is will be built with a touch screen display connected to a arduino (uno/mega) and portable battery

The device introduces itself as a Virtue-Signal.exe and portrays itself as the sole device capable of spiritual augmented reality - where it connects to your conscious and claims to know whether you are going to heaven or hell. It then inquires whether you'd like to see it do so. 

Agreeing to the proposition will begin a sample/demo question that has no consequence on the overall result (unrelated to the scenario below)

Disagreeing will restart the device and dedisplay the opening lines

Next proposition is another harmless yet this time consequential decision that will then begin the virtue/sin mechanic
(someone hands you a cig, do you accept or? and the options are either +1 virtue or +1 indulgence)

Virtual points outweigh sin points by 2x, so when points are totalled at the end of the game they will be doubled and then compared to sin points

Neither of these values are ever displayed to the player, the only indication that immoral decisions are happening is the scenarios become more and more ethically questionable (sometimes there will be no correct answer)

Some scenarios will be gimmes for the purpose of getting free virtue points, but also stopping points for the player to purposely worsen their sin score and descend a level lower in the scenario tier list

the idea is to not take the "heaven or hell" concept too cynically, bc it's quickly distanced from that concept to something more immersive and interesting than the results of a facebook-like quiz "where do you go when you die" 

The concept of building my own console is still relevant as its responsible for contributing an analog horror concept of forcing the player to use an interface they're not familiar with

Seven Sins/Indulgences
Lust - Gluttony - Greed - Sloth - Wrath - Envy - Pride

Virtue Points: They are obtained by either doing the opposite of implied sins in each scenario or doing free self sacrificing acts that do not correspond with any Sin. There will be more opportunities to gain Virtue points than sin points in any one category, but more of the options in each scenario will represent an exclusive sin to that category (ex no scenario will have two options that rack up Envy points)
